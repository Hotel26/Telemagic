# Telemagic
A Kerbal Space Program extension to promote aerospace transportation networks

A prototype Java version exists at https://spacedock.info/mod/1627/Telemagic

A new, fully ingame, plugin version is under development and will be announced when ready.  Its source code will be published here on Github when released.

Briefly, Telemagic provides one, multifunction button in Flight View.  Clicking the button causes the active vessel:

    o  to be teleported to Baikerbanur (BKB), if on the KSC runway or launchpad
    o  to be refueled, if on the designated refueling aprons at KSC or BKB
    o  to be refueled, if within 30 meters of a qualifying Telemagic "hub airport control tower"
    
Telemagic does not supplant the function of mining in KSP but provides a streamlined alternative.  Nor is it a "cheat" as finding and surveying a flat enough site for a hub airport and then deploying a control tower there is no easy feat.
