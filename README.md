# Telemagic
A Kerbal Space Program extension to promote aerospace transportation networks

Telemagic provides one, multifunction button in Flight View.  Clicking the button causes the active vessel:

    o  to be refueled, if on one of the designated refueling aprons at KSC, Island Airport, Dessert Strip or Baikerbanur
    o  to be refueled from its selected target, if both craft are 'parked' and within 30 meters of each other
    o  to be teleported to Baikerbanur (BKB), if on the KSC runway or launchpad [feature on hold]
