			   Welcome to Telemagic!
			   =====================



This is (finally) the 1.3.1.8 "Spring" release of Telemagic and the one that drops
straight into KSP as a standard plug-in!

This release supports KSP 1.3.x, but not yet release of KSP 1.4.  (Support
for KSP 1.4 will be provided as soon as possible.)

Before installing this version of Telemagic, please delete
GameData\Telemagic first if you had installed the older, Java version.  Then
install as normal, unpacking the zip file into your KSP directory.  It
should load files only into GameData/Telemagic.

With Telemagic, you receive, free, one copy of the Cruise Aquila reference
design for launching a hub control tower.  See the video "Aquila Cruise":
https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=ssGQp8Cepjc for an illustration of
pinpoint landing a Telemagic control tower from orbital or sub-orbital
flight.

For any questions, suggestions or difficulty reports, please contact Hotel26
via the KSP Forum page:

or via PM within the forum.  Thank you.



In brief, Telemagic does the following for you:

    1. teleports craft parked on the KSC runway to the Baikerbanur
       cosmodrome flight line, ready for departure (grass strip).


    2. teleports craft on the KSC launchpad to the Baikerbanur cosmodrome
       "launchpad", ready for departure.[1]


    3. refuels aircraft parked on the KSC refueling apron.
       [between the white lines on the taxiway by the tanks located just
       north of the control tower by the runway]


    4. refuels aircraft parked on the BKB (Baikerbanur) refuling apron.
       [west side of Building 11A]


    5. detects "hub airports" and refuels aircraft parked in the refueling
       apron designated at those locations.  [Within about 30 meters of the
       control tower.]


A hub airport has dual runways (marked by 4 flags) and a control tower which
is defined as having a cupola >= 8m from the ground.  [Imagine a cupola on
top of 4 HitchHiker cabins.]



Telemagic was inspired by the recent KSP forum Regional Airport Challenge
and the intention for Telemagic is that it stimulate the creation of global/
regional aviation networks on Kerbin to further its exploration and
colonization.  My thanks to the sponsors of that forum challenge!!



How to install Telemagic: unpack it into GameData\Telemagic, as usual.
